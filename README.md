# web-browser-from-scratch
Since I have build an HTTP protocol server atop TCP/IP as well as a concurrent WSGI from scratch, I'm building my own web browser engine and thus web browser. This project is for me to learn about the web browser I use everyday involving heavy debugging with DevTools and a deeper understanding of Chromium.
