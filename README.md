# rust-web-browser-from-scratch
Since I have build an HTTP protocol server atop TCP/IP as well as a concurrent WSGI from scratch, I'm building my own web browser engine and thus web browser in Rust.

This project is for me to learn about the web browser I use everyday involving heavy debugging with DevTools and a deeper understanding of Chromium.

Shoutout to Matt Brubek.
